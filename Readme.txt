Very simple script designed to make telegram stickers styled after BR railway signs 
to use the script, run the file named Script.py, and follow the instructions, it will then create the file as a PNG
You'll need cairosvg for this so yeah, install that
if you find any bugs, you're best off solving them yourself, I know shit all about programming
