Very simple script designed to make telegram stickers styled after BR railway signs 
to use the script, run the file named Script.py, and follow the instructions, it will then create the file as a PNG
To use the correct font, either copy the included ttf file (made by Evelyn Snow) to your .fonts folder if on linux, or just run it if you are on windows.
